I don't feel a single thing	A
Have the pills done too much	B
Haven't caught up with my friends in weeks	C
And now we're outta touch	D
I've been drivin' in LA	E
And the world it feels too big	F
Like a floating ball that's bound to break	G
Snap my psyche like a twig	H
And I just wanna see	H
If you feel the same as me	G
Do you ever get a little bit tired of life	F
Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die	E
Like you're hangin' by a thread but you gotta survive	D
'Cause you gotta survive	C
